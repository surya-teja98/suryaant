What does Build Tool mean?
Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code. Building incorporates compiling, linking and packaging the code into a usable or executable form. In small projects, developers will often manually invoke the build process. This is not practical for larger projects, where it is very hard to keep track of what needs to be built, in what sequence and what dependencies there are in the building process. Using an automation tool allows the build process to be more consistent.

What are build tools?
Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code (e.g., .apk for an Android app). Building incorporates compiling, linking and packaging the code into a usable or executable form.
Basically build automation is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks that software developers do in their day-to-day activities like:
1.	Downloading dependencies.
2.	Compiling source code into binary code.
3.	Packaging that binary code.
4.	Running tests.
5.	Deployment to production systems.
